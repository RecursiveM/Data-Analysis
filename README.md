# Data-Analysis
This Repository contains four projects of mine that been used to complete Udacity Nano degree program (Data Analysis)

## Project 1: 
Was effortless. Not worth uploading.


## Project 2:
In this project, i analyzed a dataset and then communicate myfindings about it. I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier
i went through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. Later Nanodegree projects will focus on individual pieces of the data analysis process.

I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!




## Project 3:

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.

For this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try 
and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. my goal was to work through this notebook 
to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

`Unfortunately, I cannot provide datasets and other provided resoursces`.



## Project 4:

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, i gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. I documented my wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcased them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.

The dataset that i would be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for you to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. More on this soon.


`tasks accomplished`

Step 1: Gathering data

Step 2: Assessing data

Step 3: Cleaning data

Step 4: Storing data

Step 5: Analyzing, and visualizing data

Step 6: Reporting



## Project 5:

This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, i used Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, i produced a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. The primary method of conveying your findings will be through transforming my exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.

`Presentation was accomplished by doing slidedeck html page`
