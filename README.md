# Data-Analysis
This Repository contains four projects of mine that been used to complete Udacity Nano degree program (Data Analysis)


## investigate-a-dataset-template:
In this project, i  analyzed a dataset and then communicate myfindings about it. I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier
i went through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. Later Nanodegree projects will focus on individual pieces of the data analysis process.

I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!




## Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook:

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.

For this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try 
and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. my goal was to work through this notebook 
to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

`Unfortunately, I cannot provide datasets and other provided resoursces`.
